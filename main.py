"""
Single entrypoint for Assignment 1. Run:

    uv run python main.py train    # runs train.py, or train.ipynb if you used a notebook
    uv run python main.py app      # runs app.py, or app.ipynb if you used a notebook

Whichever format you used (script or notebook) for a stage, this looks for
`<stage>.py` first, then `<stage>.ipynb`, and runs it the same way every time:
a notebook is first converted to a plain script (`jupyter nbconvert --to
script`) and then executed exactly like a .py file would be. This matters for
`app`: your Gradio app calls `demo.launch()`, which blocks and opens a
browser tab — running it as a real script (not inside a Jupyter kernel) is
what makes that work whether you wrote app.py or app.ipynb.

Do not rename this file or its two subcommands — grading runs exactly these
two commands against your submission.
